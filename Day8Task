Question1:
    Implement Muliple inhertance with traits
   
Trait GetStarted --> has implemented method prepare
Trait Cook extends GetStarted --> has implemented method prepare (super.prepare call must be there)
Trait Seasoning ---> has implemented method applySeasoning
Class Food extends Cook with Seasoning --> Has implemented method prepareFood
          that calls prepare and Seasoning

          the order of execution must be

          GetStarted prepare
          Cook prepare
          Seasoning applySeasoning

Check whether there is need of abstract override and comment why in the submisstion


Question 2
----------

trait Task --->  doTask (implemented method)
trait Cook  extends Task --> doTask (override)
trait Garnish extends Cook --> doTask (overide)
trait Pack extends Garnish --> doTask (overide)
class Activity extends Task---> doActivity ---> Call for doTask


create object in main method 

val:Task = new Activity with Cook with Garnish with Pack

observe the behavior

observe the behavior by changing the order of inheritance
